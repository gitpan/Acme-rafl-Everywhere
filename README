DESCRIPTION
    If you haven't already seen "rafl" somewhere, you probably haven't been
    alive for too long, because he really is everywhere.

    Moose, MooseX::Declare, Catalyst, Dist::Zilla, signatures, KiokuDB,
    Gtk2, Perl core, MetaCPAN and GSoC are just *some* of the projects he's
    involved in.

    There is proof for at least one fact noted by this distribution:
    http://t.co/jcne0k4p, taken at YAPC::EU 2012.

HELP ADD MORE FACTS
    Please add more facts! We accept pull requests, patches, emails, IRC
    messages, fortune cookie notes, sky writings, scribbled messages on
    public bathroom stalls, inappropriate mid-meeting whispers, and more.

BUGS
    This module cannot contain all the information about "rafl", but you're
    more than welcome to add any new info.

THANKS
    To "rafl" for being everywhere. :)
