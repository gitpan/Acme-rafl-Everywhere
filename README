DESCRIPTION
    If you haven't already seen "rafl" somewhere, you probably haven't been
    alive for too long, because he really is everywhere.

    Moose, MooseX::Declare, Catalyst, Dist::Zilla, signatures, KiokuDB,
    Gtk2, Perl core, MetaCPAN and GSoC are just *some* of the projects he's
    involved in.

    There is proof for at least one fact noted by this distribution, taken
    at YAPC::EU 2012.
